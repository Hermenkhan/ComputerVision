# ComputerVision
This repository contains Python scripts and images used for both Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and computer vision tasks. The focus is on data visualization techniques and image-based tasks, which are necessary for understanding and analyzing various datasets .

# 1. Files
eda_using_bivariate_analysis.py: This script provides an in-depth exploration of bivariate analysis using the tips, titanic, flights, and iris datasets. Key visualizations include:
Scatterplots: Examine relationships between two numerical variables, including differentiation by category (e.g., sex, smoker status).
Bar Plots & Box Plots: Compare numerical and categorical data (e.g., passenger class vs. age).
Distplots & Heatmaps: Visualize the distribution and correlation of variables.
ClusterMaps & Pairplots: Use hierarchical clustering and multivariate analysis to reveal deeper patterns within the data.
# 2. Images
female.jpg: A sample image of a female subject, utilized for testing or demonstration in image-based tasks, such as facial detection or classification.
male.jpg: A sample image of a male subject, also used for similar computer vision tasks.
These images are placeholders for potential future applications in gender classification or object detection models within the broader context of computer vision.

# How to Run the Script
first clone the repository using git clone 
go into the folder using cd 
Run the Python script using 
python Files/eda_using_bivariate_analysis.py
